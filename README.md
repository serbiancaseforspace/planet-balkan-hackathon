# Welcome to the Planet Balkan Hackathon!

### We are so thrilled to have you over!

Here is a list of short guides for you to move around our virtual event:

<br>

## Pitch ideas
Use this repo's [issue tracker](https://github.com/serbiancaseforspace/planet-balkan-hackathon/issues) to introduce your ideas and start a conversation with other hackers. If you are looking for collaborators, this is the best place to let everyone know.

To create an issue, simply click on  `New Issue`,  add a Title and a description to your idea and include a [label](https://github.com/serbiancaseforspace/planet-balkan-hackathon/labels) matching the challenge you want to address.

<br>

## Form teams
If you have posted your idea in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/serbiancaseforspace/planet-balkan-hackathon/issues), make sure you keep an eye open for comments and reactions. If you are looking for a team and like an idea, feel free to let others know by up-voting their posts (_rocket emoji anyone?_). Feel free to also use [Slack](https://serbiancaseforspacehq.slack.com/) to bring attention to your ideas and recruit team members. You choose!

Once you have a team, **make sure you register using**. Team registration will open on Wednesday Oct 28th and will close Friday, Oct 30th at 12:00 CET. Please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpSvvgEXvefaFdR5kAmNVuLZP8MMREWflldm63ULf4-QFGqQ/viewform) with the detailes below to get your teams registered:
- Team name
- Idea title/name/link to issue
- Challenge
- Team admin, admin email
- Team members 
- Members mailing addresses (Optional)

We know, yet another form: think of it as the registration table where you'd check in and get a name badge at an in real life hackathon. Mailing address is optional, but if you include it, you'll receive an official hackathon bag with sweet swag mailed to you, just as in real life!

## Get Planet data
By now, you should have received an invitation to create your Planet account. If you haven't, please check your spam folder. If you already had a Planet account that uses the same email you signed up to the hackthon with, you need to take no action.

On the days leading to the hackathon, you will have data view access only. This will let you Explore our [platform](https://www.planet.com/explorer) and get familiar with the products. Do checkout Planet's [Developer Center](https://developers.planet.com/) for more info.

## How to submit demos?
Demo submission is possible until end of day Sunday, Nov 1st. Please, use [this form](https://forms.gle/oGFLyDV9Lcw8NsTF6) to submit. We will gather again on Monday, Nov 2nd to watch demos (yay!) and award the prizes to the top 3 winners of each category. 

We are expecting a video format for each demo so that judges can experience you provide a lightning talk about your solution, as you would do in real life. Feel free to use slides, animations, live coding, and other means to show off what you built during the hackathon. Please stay within the 3 minutes limit for your demo.

Also note that, although there is judging involved in a hackathon, we don't expect your demos to be flawless and spotless. Screen recordings with audio, mobile phone videos and other more creative formats are all welcome, just make sure your videos are hosted and accesible publicly. At the end of the hackathon, we will update this repo with the links to all the submitted demos.
